        a video on Panopto, you have the ability to edit your video track and apply the changes to the video right on Panopto.
        To do this:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Underneath your video, click the Edit button to bring up the video editor.
            </li>
            <img src="panopto1.png" alt=" " height="50" width="200">
            <li>
                Once the video editor is opne, you will see the timeline at the bottom of the screen with a track for each
                video stream. Typically, this will include the primary and secondary streams.
            </li>
            <img src="panopto2.png" alt = " " height ="50" width="200">
            <li>
                When you play your video, you'll see the red vertical bar move along the timeline. Use the scissors icon to trim or
                cut the video.
            </li>
            <img src="panopto3.png" alt=" " height=" " width = " ">
            <li>
                Panopto will automatically save any changes you make to the video, as you can see in the top right corner.
                However, it is essential that you hit the blue Apply button when you are finished editing in order for your changes
                to take effect.
            </li>
            <img src = "panopto4.png" alt="" height ="50" width = "200"> 
        </ol>
